# CodSoft
This repository contains all the project tasks completed during my one-month internship at CodSoft. Each project showcases practical applications of frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this internship was to strengthen my problem-solving and UI/UX design skills through hands-on web development projects.
